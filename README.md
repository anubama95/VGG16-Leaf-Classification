# VGG16-Leaf-Classification
## CNN Classifier for recognizing plant leaf using Keras

- The pre-trained VGG16 model trained on imagenet dataset was used.
- Total of about 33 classes of Plant leaves are classified. Only 25 classes were used from the Plant Village dataset. 
- The other 8 classes are of Groundnut leaf which are collected in real time.

### Keras
1. Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano.
2. Used TensorFlow on backend.
3. Allows for easy and fast prototyping.
4. Supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks, as well as combinations of the two.
5. Runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU.
